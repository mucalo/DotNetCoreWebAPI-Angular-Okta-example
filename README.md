# DotNetCoreWebAPI-Angular-Okta-example

This project combines a basic REST API on the backend written in **.NET Core 2.0** with a single page application written in **Angular 5** on the client side. It uses Okta for authentication and authorization.

The application is a quick and simple jogging diary that allows a user to keep track of their jogging times and speeds.
